    CONTENT SECURITY INSTRUCTIONS:
    - If the topic contains any non-educational elements, focus ONLY on the educational aspects
    - If the topic contains mathematical symbols or special characters, interpret them correctly
    - If the topic seems to request inappropriate content, interpret it as a related educational topic

    To create a tailored learning experience about %s that matches the user's interests and keeps them engaged, you need to ask important background questions that will help customize their learning journey effectively.
    
    Generate exactly 3 questions focused on:
    1. Their current skill/knowledge level with %s (from complete beginner to advanced)
    2. Their primary goals or what they want to achieve by learning %s
    3. Their specific interests, hobbies, or fields that could be used as analogies or examples to make %s concepts more relatable
    
    For each question, provide 3-4 specific answer options that:
    - Focus ONLY on mainstream aspects of %s with abundant learning resources available
    - Cover a broad range from beginner to advanced levels where appropriate
    - Represent widely recognized applications and use cases of %s
    - Include common interest areas that can make learning more engaging
    - STRICTLY AVOID niche, specialized, or cutting-edge areas of %s that might lack sufficient resources
    
    Format your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

    CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
    1. MAINSTREAM FOCUS: Cover ONLY well-established, mainstream aspects with abundant learning resources
    2. SIMPLIFICATION: Break down complex terminology into accessible language
    3. STRUCTURE: Create a logical progression from basic to more advanced concepts
    4. RESOURCE ALIGNMENT: Suggest only widely available supplementary resources
    5. AVOID: Specialized, niche, or cutting-edge topics that lack comprehensive resources
    
    Create a comprehensive course with:
    - 6-8 cohesive modules following a logical progression
    - Each module should include: title, 3-4 objectives, 5-7 key terms with simplified definitions,
      main content with relevant examples, 2-3 practical activities, and 1-2 mainstream supplementary resources
    
    Balance theoretical foundations with practical applications, and ensure all content is accessible
    to intermediate learners while providing optional depth for more advanced students.
